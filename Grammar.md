# Grammar

## Sentence Structure

The sentence structure is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object), with postmodifier adjectives and adverbs (adjectives and adverbs are placed after what they describe).

## Nouns

A noun is formed by a root, followed by optional suffixes and an ending.

Ending is either empty or -sa for plural.

For example kaselusesa is catgirls, which is formed from root kase, suffixes -lu and -se, and ending -sa.

Roots are gender neutral by themselves and only (pro)nouns can have number and gender.

## Verbs

To use a verb in a sentence, take the **root** (*the dictionary entry*) and add one of the following endings to it:

| Ending | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| -ne | present tense |
| -da | past tense |
| -lo | future tense |
| -do | imperative | 
| *none* | infinitive | 

*The imperative is telling somebody to do something, like "take your estrogen!" in english.*
*The infinitive is used when a verb isn't directly being done by a noun, like "eat" in "I want to eat.".*

The verb can also be postfixed by -ku to indicate uncertainty, for example "Are you sleeping?" could be worded as "?'mida somoneku".

## Article

The â€” te, used similar to english.

There is no a/an since it's implied by default.

## Punctuation

| Symbol | 	Usage/Purpose |
| ------ | ------------- |

| ; | Used to iterate through items/ideas. |
| >' | Denotes beginning of an emotional sentence, either angry or encouraging. |
| ?' | Denotes beginning of an inquisitive sentence, or a sentence implying uncertainty. |
